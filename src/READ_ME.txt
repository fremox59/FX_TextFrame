Hi dear After Effect user !
Thank you for having purchased my product :)

Please read the above instructions before using the product :

______________

COMPATIBILITY :

In order to use the product, which relies heavily on path expressions,
you'll need After Effects CC2018 or newer versions.

______________

INSTALLATION :

To install the FX TextFrame toolset :

- Copy both the "FX_TextFrame.jsxbin" and the "FX_TextFrame_assets" folder
- Go to your After Effects > ScriptUI Panels folder which is,

on Windows, here :
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC 2018+ \Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels

and for MacOS, here :
/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC 2018+/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels

- and paste them both in this "ScriptUI Panels" folder ;
- Restart After Effects, and you'll find the FX TextFrame product in your AE "Window" menu ;

It will then open as a UI panel ; drag and drop it to "dock it" into your AE layout...
and you'll be ready to play with :)

______________

LAST WORDS...

I'm pretty sure you'll love and use the product a lot, once you'll have played with its features a bit.

As a quickstart, I recommend you to have a loot at the basics, documented in a neat "Informations" window
(available by clicking the little circled  (i) button in the top right corner of the UI.)

But I also strongly advise you to view my - long and deep - 5 parts tutorial series
available on https://vimeo.com/400316080
in order to fully understand how it works and really master it !

If you encounter any problem despite of all the documentation and tutorials,
or for any suggestion or feedback, please contact me at :

Have fun with the tool and don't hesitate to spread your love for it :)
