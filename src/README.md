Hi dear After Effect user !
Thank you for having downloaded my product :)

Please read the above instructions before using the product :

## COMPATIBILITY

In order to use the product, which relies heavily on path expressions,
you'll need After Effects CC2020 or newer versions, and to ensure that you use the new "Javascript" engine (not the "Legacy extendscript" one in the "Project's Settings" > "Expression" tab)

## INSTALLATION

To install the FX TextFrame toolset :

- Copy the "FX_TextFrame_assets" folder; the "FX_TextFrame.jsx" file and the "libs" folder
- Go to your After Effects > ScriptUI Panels folder which is,

on Windows, here :
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects CC 2018+ \Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels

and for MacOS, here :
/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC 2018+/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels

- and paste them all in this "ScriptUI Panels" folder ;
- Restart After Effects, and you'll find the FX TextFrame product in your AE "Window" menu ;

It will then open as a UI panel ; drag and drop it to "dock it" into your AE layout...
and you'll be ready to play with :)

## LAST WORDS...

I'm pretty sure you'll love and use the product a lot, once you'll have played with its features a bit.

As a quickstart, I recommend you to have a loot at the basics, documented in a neat "Informations" window
(available by clicking the little circled  (i) button in the top right corner of the UI.)

If you encounter any problem or for any suggestion or feedback, please contact me at :

Have fun with the tool and don't hesitate to spread your love for it :)
