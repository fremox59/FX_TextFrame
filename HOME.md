FX TextFrame is a feature rich tool for After Effects that helps you create, customize and animate auto-resizing text "Frames" quickly and easily, with the help of a compact, well designed UI Panel, and a dedicated Pseudo-effect.

# How does it work?

First choose if you want to create a Single Line setup or a MultiLine setup, by clicking the corresponding tab button at the top of the UI.

## Single Line mode

By selecting the Single Line tab, you'll create only one single text layer once the button ***Create single FX TextFrame line*** will be clicked.
Depending of the first Toggle Icon Option called ***Toggle Mask/Shape mode*** (1), you'll end up with just this single text layer with aÂ mask onto it (if the yellow ***Mask mode*** icon with a M is the one selected), or with a text layer PLUS a shape layer parented to it if the blue ***Shape mode*** icon with a star is the selected one).

Once you have chosen the mode you want for your TextFrame setup, you can either choose to customize the other options numbered 2 to 6 in the following list, right now, or you can decide to use them afterwhile once you'll have created your TextFrame setup, it's up to you!

Here are, from left to right in the UI, the options you can tweak through an icon button or dropdown menu:

1. ***Toggle Mask/Shape mode*** (this is the only option in the UI that won't be able to change a selected FX TextFrame setup afterwhile so... mind your choice!
2. ***Corners style*** with or without Fill/Stroke
3. ***Animation direction***
4. ***Auto/Manual Frame X and Y size***
5. ***Text over Frame compositing***
6. ***Fill and Stroke colors***

Clicking the ***Create single FX TextFrame line*** will then create a new FX TextFrame line, based on the options you've set up with these icons.
