I'm Matthieu Fremeaux, aka Fremox, a senior multidisciplinary Motion Designer living in northern France.
I'm also a beta tester for Maxon (Cinema4D and Redshift), an After Effects tools developper, one of the guy behind the French Motion Café community, and a Pen Plotter enthusiast :)

While I don't create some nice explainer videos, animated logos or nice 3D product visuaIizations, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with my peers, by showing various tips and tricks during Live sessions on our Motion Café Youtube channel, or by giving some conferences in the design schools around my living place.

And when I need a specific tool that I can't find on the market, to help me in my daily production, I try to create my own through After Effects scripting, or Cinema4D nodal capsules for example.

This is why I started to script in AE back in 2017. Over the years, I've created a few very nice tools like SpringyFX, IsomaticFX and MoglyphFX, that you can purchase on [my aescripts store. (https://aescripts.com/authors/f-l/fremox/)]

FX TextFrame is my first tool ever published as an open source one, and I\'92m glad to be part of this promising platform : I will do my best to publish some other ones in the future :)
