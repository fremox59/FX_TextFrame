I\'92m Matthieu Fremeaux, aka Fremox, a senior multidisciplinary Motion Designer living in northern France.\
I\'92m also a beta tester for Maxon (Cinema4D and Redshift), an After Effects tools developper, one of the guy behind the French Motion Caf\'e9 community, and a Pen Plotter enthusiast :)\
\
While I don\'92t create some nice explainer videos, animated logos or nice 3D product visuaIizations, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with my peers, by showing various tips and tricks during Live sessions on our Motion Caf\'e9 Youtube channel, or by giving some conferences in the design schools around my living place.\
\
And when I need a specific tool that I can\'92t find on the market, to help me in my daily production, I try to create my own through After Effects scripting, or Cinema4D nodal capsules for example.\
\
This is why I started to script in AE back in 2017. Over the years, I\'92ve created a few very nice tools like SpringyFX, IsomaticFX and MoglyphFX, that you can purchase on my aescripts store : https://aescripts.com/authors/f-l/fremox/\
\
FX TextFrame is my first tool ever published as an open source one, and I\'92m glad to be part of this promising platform : I will do my best to publish some other ones in the future :)\
